### Hi there, I'm Ashwin Mathur!!

My interests lie in Natural Language Processing and its applications. 

I recently began contributing to the Data Science open-source community. Contributing allows me to work in a collaborative environment and provides a fantastic learning experience. The idea that a small contribution can generate a large impact almost instantly is what motivates me to contribute.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a final year Masters Student studying Data Science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use NLP to build useful applications.
- Open Source Contributions:
